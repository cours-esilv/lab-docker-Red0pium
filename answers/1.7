docker image ls
docker rmi <image_id> (I took all the image ids of image created less than 2 hours ago)
sometimes I had this type of error : "image is being used by stopped container 7fd7d05f8aca"
so I had to run : "docker rm <container_id>"
then I could remove images
(for the tags I had to put the image names instead of the id)
